El Rogue del Rey

This game is a roguelike with graphics! And far fewer nice features!

How to Play:
The Start Screen has two buttons, "Start Game" and "Exit." Select
these buttons with the mouse.

The controls are simple and intuitive. Using the keyboard, select the
adjacent tile you'd like to interact with.
 Q  W  E
  \ | /
A - S - D
  / | \
 Z  X  C

S represents your character and is the key to rest a turn in the
current tile.
The keys WDXA point in the cardinal directions NESW, respectively,
and control movement in those directions.
Diagonal movement is controlled using the QECZ keys for the 
diagonal directions NW, NE, SE, SW, respectively.

If you want to move into an empty tile, simply press the key for that
tile.
If you want to attack an enemy on a tile, press the key for that tile
and you will attack instead of moving into it.
If you want to walk into a wall, press the key for that tile. Don't
worry, this won't waste your turn.

To exit the game during play, hit the escape key.

Cheat codes:
While playing, press I for the first level and O for the second.

Originial Low Bar Items:
* 3 levels of tile based dungeons (not procedurally generated)
	partially complete: two levels with enemies, but no doors
* 1 player character
	complete.
* Basic RPG modifiers attack, defense, and hit points
	complete.
* At least 3 unique enemies (graphics, hit points, damage)
	complete: There are 12.
* Enemy path finding: chase player when spotted, wander dungeon otherwise
	complete: Hacked, since line of sight is not implemented, the
	paths only start when the player is within 8 tiles of an Actor
* HUD player and level info
	partially complete: Not graphics, just strings.
* Basic fog/line of sight, doors control sight of rooms
	incomplete: Everything is visible.
* Screen scrolls with character movement
	abandoned: Dr. Wallace and I agreed that this, included with the 
	rest, would be too complex, so scrolling was abandoned.
